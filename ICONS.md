# PWA Icons Setup

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add icon files to the `public` directory:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels
3. **favicon.ico** - Standard favicon

## Quick Setup

You can generate these icons using:
- Online tools like [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- Image editing software
- Or use a simple colored square with the text "CS" for Community Sales

## Placeholder Icons

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons:
- Use any image editor to create 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files
- Add them to the `public` directory
- The app will work without them, but they're required for proper PWA installation
